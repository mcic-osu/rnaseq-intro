## Introduction

Many of the things you typically do by pointing and clicking can alternatively
be done by typing commands.
The Unix shell allows you to interact with computers via commands.
It is natively available through a Terminal app in computers with Unix-like
operating systems like Linux (on which OSC runs) or MacOS,
and can also be installed on Windows computers with relatively
little trouble these days
(see the [SSH reference page on this website](../info/osc_ssh.qmd)).

Working effectively on a remote supercomputer tends to simply _require_ using a
command line interface.
But there are more **advantages to doing command line computing**
than just allowing you to work on a supercomputer, such as:

  - Working efficiently with large files
  - Achieving better reproducibility in research
  - Performing general computing tasks more efficiently, once you get the hang of it
  - Making it much easier to repeat similar tasks across files, samples,
    and projects, with the possibility of true automation
  - For bioinformatics, being able to use (the latest) command-line programs directly
    without having to depend on "GUI wrappers" written by third parties,
    that often cost money and also lag behind in functionality

In these sessions, **we'll use a Unix shell at OSC inside VS Code**.
For this session, specifically,
I will assume you still have an active VS Code session as setup in the
[previous one](02_osc.qmd), have VS Code located at `/fs/ess/PAS0471`,
and with an open Terminal &mdash; if not, see the instructions in the dropdown
box right below.

[^1]: But just for reference, there are other ways of accessing a Unix shell at OSC:
for example, you can also get Shell access through the "Clusters" menu
in OSC OnDemand,
or you could connect your local Unix shell to OSC through SSH
(again, [see this reference page](../info/osc_ssh.qmd)).

:::{.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Starting VS Code at OSC - with a Terminal (Click to expand)
1. Log in to OSC's OnDemand portal at <https://ondemand.osc.edu>.
2. In the blue top bar, select `Interactive Apps`
   and then near the bottom of the dropdown menu, click `Code Server`.
3. In the form that appears on a new page:
   - Select an appropriate OSC project (here: `PAS0471`)
   - For this session, select `/fs/ess/PAS0471` as the starting directory
   - Make sure that `Number of hours` is at least `2`
   - Click `Launch`.
4. On the next page, once the top bar of the box has turned green
   and says `Runnning`, click `Connect to VS Code`.

<figure><p align="center"><img src=img/osc-code-launch_ed.png width="80%"></p></figure>

5. Open a Terminal by clicking
   &nbsp; {{< fa bars >}} &nbsp; => `Terminal` => `New Terminal`.
   (Or use one of the keyboard shortcuts:
   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (backtick) or
   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.)
6. Type `pwd` to check where you are.
   If you are not in `/fs/ess/PAS0471`,
   click `Open folder...` in the `Welcome` tab,
   or &nbsp; {{< fa bars >}} &nbsp; => &nbsp; `File` &nbsp; => &nbsp; `Open Folder`,
   then type/select `/fs/ess/PAS0471` and press Ok.

#### Some Terminology

We're going to focus on the practice of doing command line computing here,
and not get too bogged down in terminology,
but let's highlight a few interrelated terms you're likely to run across:

  - **Command Line** &mdash; the most general term, an interface where you type commands
  - **Terminal** &mdash; the program/app/window that can run a Unix shell 
  - **Shell** &mdash; a command line interface to your computer
  - **Unix Shell** &mdash; the types of shells on Unix family (Linux + Mac) computers 
  - **Bash** &mdash; the specific Unix shell language that is most common on Unix computers
  - **Bash Shell** &mdash; a Unix shell that uses the Bash language
  
While it might not fly for a computer science class,
for day-to-day computing/bioinformatics,
you'll probably hear all these terms used somewhat interchangably.
Basically, we're talking about the process of interacting with your computer by
giving it commands as opposed to the point-and-click way you're likely more familiar with.

:::

<br>

## First steps

### The prompt

Inside your terminal, the "prompt" indicates that the shell is ready for a command.
What is shown exactly varies a bit across shells and can also be customized,
but our prompts at OSC should show the following:

``` {.bash-in-nocolor}
[<username>@<node-name> <working-dir>]$
```

For example:

``` {.bash-in-nocolor}
[jelmer@p0080 PAS0471]$ 
```

We type our commands after the dollar sign,
and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute the command.
When the command has finished executing,
we'll get our prompt back and can type a new command.

::: {.callout-tip}
#### How shell code is presented on this website
The pale gray boxes like the ones shown above will be used to represent your
command prompt, or rather, to show the command line expressions that you
will type.

In upcoming boxes, the prompt itself (`[...]$`) will not be shown,
but only the command line expressions that you type.
This is to save space and also because if we omit the prompt,
you will be able to directly copy and paste commands from the website to your shell. 

Also, in a notation like `<username>`,
the `< >` are there to indicate this is not an actual, functional example,
but a descriptive generalization, and should not be part of the final code.
In this case, then, it should be replaced merely by a username (e.g. `jelmer`),
and _not_ by `<jelmer>`, as you can see in the example with the prompt above.
:::

<br>

### A few simple commands: `date`, `whoami`, `pwd`

The Unix shell comes with hundreds of commands.
Let's start with a few simple ones.

The `date` command prints the current date and time:

```{bash, eval=TRUE}
date
```

::: {.callout-tip}
#### Copying code from the website, and code output
When you hover your mouse above the top box with the command
(sometime you have to click in it first),
you should see a copy icon appear on the far right,
which will copy the command to your clipboard:
for longer expressions, this can be handy so you can paste this right into your shell
and don't have to type.
Generally speaking, though, learning works better when you type the commands yourself!

Also, the darker gray box below, with italic text,
is intended to show the _output_ of commands as they are printed to the screen
in the shell.
:::

The `whoami` (who-am-i) command prints your username:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
whoami
```

``` {.bash-out}
jelmer
```

The `pwd` (Print Working Directory) commands prints the path to the directory
you are currently located in:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
pwd
```

``` {.bash-out}
/fs/ess/PAS0471
```

All 3 commands that we just used provided us with some output.
_That output was **printed to screen**,
which is the default behavior for nearly every Unix command_.

:::{.callout-note}
#### Working directories, and paths part I

On Unix systems,
all the files on a computer exist within **a single hierarchical system of directories**
(folders).
When working in the Unix shell, you are always "in" one of these directories.
The directory you're "in" at any given time is referred to as your **working directory**.

In a **path** (specification of a file or directory location)
such as that output by `pwd`, directories are separated by forward slashes `/`.

A **leading forward slash** in a path indicates the root directory of the computer,
and as such, the path provided by `pwd` is an _absolute path_ (or: _full path_),
and not a _relative path_ &mdash; more on that later.

While not shown in the `cd` output,
if you _happen to see_ a **trailing forward slash** in a path
(eg. `/fs/ess/PAS0471/`),
you can be sure that the path points to a directory and not a file.
:::

<br><br>

## `cd` and command actions, defaults, and arguments

In the above three command line expressions:

- We merely typed the _name of a command and nothing else_
- The main function of the command was to _provide some information_,
  which was the output printed to screen

But many commands perform an **action** other than printing output.
For example, the very commonly used command **`cd` (Change Directory)**
will, you guessed it,
change your working directory.
And as it happens, it normally has no output at all.

We start by simply typing `cd`:

``` {.bash-in-nocolor}
[jelmer@p0080 PAS0471]$ cd
[jelmer@p0080 ~]$
```

Did anything happen?
You might expect a command like `cd` to _report_ what it did, but it does not.
As a general rule for Unix commands that perform actions,
and one that also applies to `cd`:
**if the command does not print any output, this means it was successful.**

So where did we change our working directory to, given that we did not tell
`cd` where to move?
Our _prompt_ (as shown in the code box below) actually did give us a clue:
`PAS0471` was changed to `~` But what does `~` mean?

:::{.exercise}
#### Your Turn: Check what directory we moved to {-}
<details><summary>Solution (click here)</summary>
```bash
pwd
```
```{.bash-out}
/users/PAS0471/jelmer
```
It appears that we moved to our Home directory!
(Remember, we were in the Project directory `/fs/ess/PAS0471`.)

And as it turns out,
`~` is a shell shortcut to indicate your Home directory &mdash;
more on that later.

</details>
:::

From this, we can infer that the **default behavior** of `cd`,
i.e. when it is not given any additional information,
is to move to a user's home directory.
This is actually a nice trick to remember!

Now, let's move to another directory, one that contains some files we can explore
to learn our next few commands.
We can do so by specifying the _path_ to that directory after the `cd` command
(make sure to leave a space after `cd`!):

```bash
cd /fs/ess/PAS0471/demo/202307_rnaseq/
```

```bash
pwd
```
```{.bash-out}
/fs/ess/PAS0471/demo/202307_rnaseq
```

In more abstract terms, what we did above was to provide `cd` with an **argument**
(namely, the path to the dir to move to).
Arguments generally tell commands what file or directory to operate on,
and come at the end of a command line expression.
There should always be a space between the command and its argument(s)!

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Tab completion!! (Click to expand)

- After typing `/fs/e`, press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key!

    ```{.bash-out-solo}
    /fs/ess/
    ```

- After typing `/fs/ess/P`, press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.
  Nothing will happen, so now press it quickly twice in succession.
  
  ```{.bash-out-solo}
  Display all 709 possibilities? (y or n)
  ```

  Type `n`. Why does this happen?

- After typing `/fs/ess/PAS04`, press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key twice quickly in
  succession ("Tab-tab").

  ```{.bash-out-solo}
  PAS0400/ PAS0409/ PAS0418/ PAS0439/ PAS0453/ PAS0456/ PAS0457/ PAS0460/ PAS0471/ PAS0472/ PAS0498/ 
  ```

- After typing `/fs/ess/PAS0471/demo/2`, press the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key!

  ```{.bash-out-solo}
  /fs/ess/PAS0471/demo/202307_rnaseq/
  ```

The tab completion feature will check for files/dirs present in the location
you're at,
and based on the characters you've typed so for,
complete the path as far as it can.

Sometimes it can't move forward at all because there are multiple files or dirs
that have the same next character.
Pressing "Tab-tab" will then show your options,
though in unusual circumstances like one above, there are so many that it asks
for confirmation.
In such cases, it's usually better to just keep typing assuming that you know
where you want to go.

In general, though, Tab completion is an _incredibly_ useful feature that you should
try to get accustomed to using right away!
:::

As we've seen, then, `cd` gives no output when it succesfully changed the
working directory ("silence is golden"!).
But let's also see what happens when it does not succeed &mdash;
it gives the following error:

```bash
cd /fs/Ess/PAS0471
```
``` {.bash-out}
bash: cd: /fs/Ess/PAS0471: No such file or directory
```

:::{.exercise}
#### Your Turn: What was the problem with the path we specified? {-}
<details><summary>Solutions (click here)</summary>
We used a capital E in `/Ess/` &mdash; this should have been `/ess/`.

In other words, paths (dir and file specifications) are **case-sensitive**
on Unix systems!
</details>
:::

**In summary**, in this section we've learned that:

- The **`cd` command** can be used to change your working directory
- Unix commands like `cd` that perform **actions**
  will by default only print output to screen when something goes wrong (i.e., errors)
- Commands can have _default behaviours_ when they are not given specific directions
- We can give commands like `cd` **arguments** to tell them what to do / operate on.

Next, we'll learn about _options_ to commands in the context of the `ls` command.

<br>

## `ls` and command _options_

### The default behavior of `ls`

The `ls` command, short for "list",
is a quite flexible command to list files and directories:

```bash
ls
```
``` {.bash-out}
data  metadata  README.md
```

(You should still be in `/fs/ess/PAS0471/demo/202307_rnaseq`.
If not, `cd` there first.)

:::{.callout-tip}
#### `ls` output colors
Unfortunately, the `ls` output shown above does not show the different colors
you should see in your shell &mdash; here are some of the most common ones:

- Entries in <span style="color: #0328fc">blue</span> are directories
  (like `data` and `metadata` above)
- Entries in black are regular files (like `README.md` above)
- Entries in <span style="color: #d92118">red</span> are compressed files
  (we'll see an example soon).
:::

The default behavior of `ls` includes that it will:

- List files and dirs inside our current working directory,
  and do so _non-recursively_: it won't list files inside those directories, and so on.
- Show as many files and dirs as it can on one line, each separated by a few spaces
- Sort files and dirs alphabetically (and not separately so)
- Not show any other details about the files, such as their size, owner, and so on.

All of this, and more, can be changed by providing `ls` with **options** and/or
**arguments**.

### First, more on arguments

Let's start with an _argument_, since we're familiar with those in the context of `cd`.
Any argument to `ls` should be **a path to operate on**.
For example, if we wanted to see what's inside that mysterious `data` dir,
we could type:

```bash
ls data
```
```{.bash-out}
fastq
```

Well, that's not much information, just another dir &mdash;
so let's look inside that:

```bash
ls data/fastq  # These will be shown in red in your output, since they are compressed
```
```{.bash-out}
ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz  ASPC1_G31V_R2.fastq.gz      Miapaca2_G31V_R1.fastq.gz
ASPC1_A178V_R2.fastq.gz  Miapaca2_A178V_R1.fastq.gz  Miapaca2_G31V_R2.fastq.gz
ASPC1_G31V_R1.fastq.gz   Miapaca2_A178V_R2.fastq.gz
```

Ah, there are some gzipped FASTQ files!
These contain our sequence data, and we'll go and explore them in a bit.

We can also provide `ls` with **multiple arguments** &mdash;
and it will nicely tell us which files are in each of the dirs we specified:

```bash
ls data metadata
```

```{.bash-out}
data:
fastq

metadata:
meta.tsv
```

Many Unix commands will accept multiple arguments (files or dirs to operate on),
which can be very useful.

### Options

Finally, we'll turn to options.
Whereas, in general, _arguments_ tell a command what to operate on,
_options_ (also called "flags") will modify its behavior.

For example, we can call `ls` with the **option `-l`**
(a dash followed by a lowercase L):

```bash
ls -l 
```

```{.bash-out}
total 17
drwxr-xr-x 3 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Jul 27 11:53 data
drwxr-xr-x 2 jelmer PAS0471 4096 Jul 27 11:54 metadata
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471  963 Jul 27 16:48 README.md
```

Notice that it lists the same three items as our first `ls` call above,
but now, they're printed in a different format:
one item per line, with lots of additional information included.
For example, the date and time is that **when the file was last modified**,
and the numbers just to the left of that (e.g., `4096`) show
the **file sizes** in bytes[^2].

[^2]: Though these sizes are only directly useful for files, not dirs!
      You can also ignore the `total 17` line at the top.

Let's add another option, `-h` &mdash; before reading on,
can you pick out what it did to modify the output?

```bash
ls -l -h
```

```{.bash-out}
total 17K
drwxr-xr-x 3 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Jul 27 11:53 data
drwxr-xr-x 2 jelmer PAS0471 4.0K Jul 27 11:54 metadata
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471  964 Jul 27 17:48 README.md
```

Note the difference in the format of the column reporting the sizes of the items listed
&mdash; we now have "human-readable filesizes", 
where sizes on the scale of kilobytes will be shown in `K`s,
of megabytes in `M`s,
and of gigabytes in `G`s.

Many options have a "**long option**" counterpart, i.e. a more verbose way of
specifying the option.
For example, `-h` can also be specified as `--human-readable`:

```bash
ls -l --human-readable      # Output not shown, same as above
```

(And then there are also options that are only available in long format &mdash;
even with case-sensitivity, one runs out of single-letter abbreviations at some point!)

Despite that **short options** like the `-l` and `-s` we've seen (single-dash, single-letter)
are very terse and may at times seem impossible to remember,
they are still often preferred with common Unix commands,
because they are shorter to type &mdash;
and keep in mind that you might use, say, `ls -lh` dozens if not hundreds of time
a day if you work in the Unix shell a lot.

A very useful feature of "short options" is that they can be pasted together as
follows:

```bash
ls -lh   # Output not shown, same as above
```

::: {.callout-note}
#### More on the long-format output of `ls`
The figure below shows what information is shown in each of the columns
(but note that it shows a different listing of files,
and uses the new-to-us **`-a` option, short for "all"**,
to also show "hidden files"):

<p align="center"><img src=img/long-ls.png width="80%"></p>
:::

<br>

### Combining options and arguments

Finally, we can **combine options and arguments**,
and let's do so take a closer look at our dir with FASTQ files &mdash;
now the `-h` option is especially useful because it makes it easy to see that the files
vary between 4.1 MB and 5.3 MB in size:

```bash
ls -lh data/fastq
```

``` {.bash-out}
total 38M
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 4.1M Jul 27 11:53 ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 4.2M Jul 27 11:53 ASPC1_A178V_R2.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 4.1M Jul 27 11:53 ASPC1_G31V_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 4.3M Jul 27 11:53 ASPC1_G31V_R2.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 5.1M Jul 27 11:53 Miapaca2_A178V_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 5.3M Jul 27 11:53 Miapaca2_A178V_R2.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 5.1M Jul 27 11:53 Miapaca2_G31V_R1.fastq.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 5.3M Jul 27 11:53 Miapaca2_G31V_R2.fastq.gz
```

(Beginners are often inclined to move to a directory when they just want to
`ls` its contents, but its often more convenient to stay put and use an
argument to `ls` instead, like we did above.)

<br>

### Recap of `ls`, arguments, and options

In summary, in this section we have learned that:

- The `ls` command lists files (by default without additional info and non-recursively)

- Using _arguments_, we tell `ls` (and other commands) what to operate on.
  Arguments come at the end of the command line epxression, and are not preceded by
  a dash or any other "pointer".
  They are typically names of files or dirs, but can be other things too.

- Using _options_, we can make `ls` (and other commands) show us the results in
  different ways. They are preceded by at least one dash (`-`, like `-l`).

::: {.callout-note}
#### Other types of options

The options we've seen so far act as "on/off switches",
and this is very common among Unix commands.

**But some options are not on/off switches and accept values**
(confusingly, these values can also be called "arguments" to options).
For example, the `--color` option to `ls` determines how it colorizes its output:
there is `ls --color=never` &mdash; versus, among other possibilities,
`ls --color=always`.

We'll see _a lot_ of options that take values when running bioinformatics
programs,
**such as to set specific analysis parameters** &mdash;
for example:
`trim_galore --quality 30 --length 50` would set a minimum Phred quality score
threshold of 30 and a minimum read length threshold of 50 bases for the program
TrimGalore, which we will later use to quality-trim and adapter-trim FASTQ files.
(This `--<option> <value>` syntax, i.e. without an `=` is more common than
the `--<option>=<value>` syntax shown for `ls` above.)

In contrast to when you are using common Unix commands, I would recommend to mostly
_use **long options** whenever available when running bioinformatics programs like TrimGalore._
That way, it’s easier for you to remember what you did with that option,
and more likely to be immediately understood by anyone else reading the code
(cf. `trim_galore -q 30 -l 50` and `trim_galore --quality 30 --length 50`).
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### The `tree` command and recursive `ls` (Click to expand)

The `tree` command lists files _recursively_ (i.e., it will also show us what's
contained in the directories in our working directory),
and does so in a tree-like fashion &mdash;
this can be great to quickly get an intuitive overview of files in a dir:

```bash
tree -C     # The -C option will colorize the output
```
<p align="left"><img src=img/tree_output.png width="50%"></p>

As an aside: if we want to make `ls` list files recursively,
we can use the `-R` option:

```bash
ls -R
```
```{.bash-out}
.:
data  metadata  README.md

./data:
fastq

./data/fastq:
ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz  ASPC1_G31V_R2.fastq.gz      Miapaca2_G31V_R1.fastq.gz
ASPC1_A178V_R2.fastq.gz  Miapaca2_A178V_R1.fastq.gz  Miapaca2_G31V_R2.fastq.gz
ASPC1_G31V_R1.fastq.gz   Miapaca2_A178V_R2.fastq.gz

./metadata:
meta.tsv
```

## Paths

As we've mentioned,
"paths" are specifications of a location on a computer,
either of a file or a directory.

We've talked about the commands `cd` and `ls` that operate on paths,
and without going into much detail about it so far, 
we've already seen two distinct ways of specifying paths:

- **Absolute (full) paths** always start from the root directory of the computer,
  which is represented by a _**leading `/`**_, such as in `/fs/scratch/PAS0471/`.
  
  _(Absolute paths are like GPS coordinates to specify a geographic location on earth:_
  _they will provide location information regardless of where we are ourselves.)_

- **Relative paths** start from your current location (working directory).
  When we typed `ls data` earlier,
  we indicated that we wanted to show the contents of the
  `data` directory located inside our current working directory &mdash;
  that probably seemed intuitive.
  But be aware that the shell would look absolutely nowhere else for that dir
  than in our current working directory.

  (_Relative paths are more like directions to a location that say things like_
  _"turn left" &mdash; these instructions depend on our current location._)

Absolute paths may seem preferable because they will work regardless of where
you are located, **but**:

- They can be a lot more typing than we need (or want) to do.
- While context-specific, a much more important disadvantage of absolute paths
  is that they can only be expected to work on one specific computer,
  and are guaranteed not to work after you move files around.

:::{.exercise}
#### How might relative dirs work on other computers or after moving files? {-}
<details><summary>Solution (click here)</summary>

Say that Lucie has a directory for a research project, `/fs/ess/PAS0471/lucie/rnaseq1`,
with lots of dirs and files contained in it.
In all her code, she specify paths relative to that top-level project directory.

Then, she share that entire directory with someone else, copying it off OSC.
If her collaborator goes wherever _they_ now have that directory stored,
e.g. `/home/philip/lucie_collab/rnaseq1`, and then start using Lucie's code
with relative paths, **they would still work**.

Similarly, if Lucie moves her dir to `/fs/scratch/PAS0805/lucie/rnaseq1`,
all her code with relative paths **would still work as well**.

This is something we'll come back to later when talking about reproducibity.
</details>
:::

<br>

### Moving "up" when using relative paths

There are a couple of "shortcuts" available for relative paths.
First of all,
`.` (a single period) is another way of representing the current working directory.
Therefore, for instance,
`ls ./data` is functionally the same as `ls data`,
and just a more explicit way of saying that the `data` dir is located in your
current working dir (this syntax is occasionally helpful).

More usefully for our purposes here, **`..` (two periods) means one level up**
in the directory hierarchy, with "up" meaning towards the root directory
(I guess the directory tree is best visualized upside down!):

```bash
ls ..               # One level up, listing /fs/ess/PAS0471/demo
```
```{.bash-out}
202307_rnaseq
```

This pattern can be continued all the way to the root of the computer,
so `../..` would list files two levels up:

```bash
ls ../..            # Two levels up, listing /fs/ess/PAS0471
```
```{.bash-out}

Along these lines, there are two other shortcuts worth mentioning:

- **`~`** represents your Home directory,
  so `cd ~` would move there and `ls ~` would list the files there

- **`-`** is a `cd`-specific shortcut that it is like the "back" button in your
  browser: it will go to your previous location.
  (But it only has a memory of 1, so subsequent `cd -`s would simply move you
  back and forth between two directories.)
  
::: {.callout-note}
#### These shortcuts work with all commands
Except for **`-`**,
all of the above shortcuts are *general shell shortcuts* that work with **any**
command that takes a path.

## Recap

We've learned about structure of command line expressions in the Unix shell,
which include: the _command_ itself, _options_, _arguments_, and _output_
(including, in some cases, error messages).

A few key general points to remember are that:

- Commands that take **actions** like changing directory
  (and the same will be true for commands that copy and move files, for example)
  will by default **not print any output to the screen**,
  only errors _if_ those occur.[^3]

[^3]: We'll see later on how we can make commands more "verbose" than they are
      by default, which can certainly be useful.

- Commands whose main function is to provide information
  (think `ls`, `date`, `pwd`) will **print their output to the screen**.
  We'll learn later how we can "redirect" output to a file or to another command!

- Using **options** (`ls -l`), we can modify the behavior of a command,
  and using **arguments** (`ls data`), we can modify what it operates on in
  the first place. 

::: {.callout-warning}
#### Always start with a command
One additional, important thing to realize about the structure of command
line expressions is this:

Everything you type on the command line
should start with the name of a command, or equivalently, a program or script
(these are all just "programs").

Therefore, for example, just typing the name of a file,
even if it exists in your current working directory,
will return an error.
(I.e., it won't do anything with that file, such as printing its contents,
like you had perhaps expected.)
This is because the first word of a command line expressio should be a command,
and the name of a file is (usually!) not a command:

```bash
README.md
```
``` {.bash-out}
README.md: command not found
```

::: {.callout-note}
#### Many bioinformatics programs are basically specialized commands
In many ways, as mentioned in the box above,
you can think of using a command-line bioinformatics program as using just another command.

Therefore, our general skills with Unix commands will very much extend to using
command-line bioinformatics tools!
:::

We've learned to work with the following truly ubiquitous Unix commands:

 - `pwd` &mdash; print your current working directory
 - `cd` &mdash; change your working directory
 - `ls` &mdash; list files and dirs

And we have seen a few other simpler utility commands as well
(`date`, `whoami`, and `tree` in a dropdown box).

We'll continue with the basics of the Unix shell in part II (TBA).

## At-home reading: getting help

We saw several different _options_ for the `ls` command,
and that may have left you wondering how you are supposed to know about them.

### The `--help` option

Many (but not all!) commands have a `--help` option which will primarily describe
the command's function and "syntax" including many of the available options.

For a very brief example, try:

```bash
whoami --help
```

For a much longer example, try:

```bash
ls --help
```

### The `man` command

The `man` command provides manual pages for Unix commands,
which is more complete than the `--help` help,
but sometimes overwhelming as well as terse and not always easy to fully understand 
&mdash; Google is your friend as well!

For a short example, try:

```bash
man pwd
```

::: {.callout-warning}
#### The man page opens in a "pager" -- try to scroll around and type <kbd>q</kbd> to quit!
:::

For a much longer example, try:

```bash
man ls
```
