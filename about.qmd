This website contains the material for a series of teaching sessions for grad students
and postdocs of the
[Cruz-Monserrate lab](https://cancer.osu.edu/for-cancer-researchers/research/research-labs/cruz-monserrate-lab)
in the fall of 2023.

These sessions focus on hands-on analysis of (short-read, bulk) RNAseq data with
command-line tools and R using the computing resources at the [Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)](https://www.osc.edu/).

This website and the teaching materials have been created by Jelmer Poelstra
at the [Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (MCIC)](https://mcic.osu.edu/)
of Ohio State University.
