setting up {-}\n\nSo far,\nwe have covered all the building blocks to be able to run command-line programs\nat OSC:\n\n- Basics of a supercomputer and of OSC specifically\n- Bash shell basics to work at a supercomputer,\n  and learn the language used in our scripts\n- The bells and whistles needed to turn our commands into a shell script\n- Loading and installing the software (command-line programs) that we want to run\n- Working with the Slurm job scheduler, so we can submit scripts as batch jobs\n- The ability to loop over commands, so that we can submit many scripts at once\n\nWith these skills,\nit's relatively straightforward to create and submit scripts that run command-line\nprograms to analyze our genomics data.\n\nIn this session,\nwe'll run FastQC to apply these skills and to actually quality-comtrol our FASTQ files.   \n\n<br>\n\n## Running FastQC\n\n### FastQC: A program for quality control of FASTQ files \n\nFastQC is one the most ubiquitous pieces of genomics software.\nIt allows you to assess the overall quality of, and potential problems with,\nthe reads in your FASTQ files.\nIt produces visualizations and assessments of FASTQ files for statistics\nsuch as per-base quality (below) and adapter content.\nRunning FastQC or an equivalent program should always be the first analysis step\nafter receiving your sequences.  \n\nFor each FASTQ file, FastQC outputs an HTML file that you can open in your\nbrowser and which has about a dozen graphs showing different QC metrics.\nThe most important one is the per-base quality score graph shown below.\n\n::: {#fig-elephants layout-ncol=2 layout-nrow=1}\n\n![](img/fastqc_good.png)\n\n![](img/fastqc_bad.png)\n\nA FastQC per-base quality score graph for files with fairly good (left) and\npoor (right) quality reads.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n### FastQC syntax\n\nTo analyze one (optionally gzipped) FASTQ file with FastQC,\nthe syntax can be as simple as:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nfastqc <fastq-file>\n```\n:::\n\n\nThough in practice, we'll want to specify the output directory &mdash;\notherwise, output files would end up in the current working directory:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nfastqc --outdir=<output-dir> <fastq-file>\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor instance, if we wanted output files to go to the directory `results/fastqc`\nand wanted the program to analyze the file `data/fastq/ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz`,\na functional command would like like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nfastqc --outdir=results/fastqc data/fastq/ASPC1_A178V_R1.fastq.gz\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## FastQC's output file names are automatically determined\nWe can specify the output _directory_, but not the actual file names,\nwhich will be automatically determined by FastQC based on the input file name.\n\nFor one FASTQ file, it will output one HTML file and one ZIP archive.\nThe latter contains files with the summary statistics that were computed and\non which the figures are based &mdash; we generally don't need to look at that.\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n### A basic FastQC script\n\nHere is what a basic script to run FastQC could look like:\n  \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Strict Bash settings\nset -euo pipefail\n\n# Copy the placeholder variables\ninput_file=\"$1\"\noutput_dir=\"$2\" \n\n# Run FastQC\nfastqc --outdir=\"$output_dir\" \"$input_file\"\n\n# (Don't run this in your terminal, but copy it into a .sh text file)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBut we'll add a few things to this script to run it smoothly as a batch job at OSC:\n\n- We load the relevant OSC module:\n\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  module load fastqc/0.11.8\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  \n- We add a few `sbatch` options:\n\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  #SBATCH --account=PAS0471\n  #SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out\n  ```\n  :::\n\n\nWe'll also add a few `echo` statements to report what's going on,\nand will create the output directory if it doesn't yet exist:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nmkdir -p \"$output_dir\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n## Refresher: the `-p` option to `mkdir` (Click to expand)\n\nUsing the `-p` option does two things at once for us,\nboth of which are necessary for a foolproof inclusion of this command\nin a script:\n\n- It will enable `mkdir` to create multiple levels of directories at once:\n  by default, `mkdir` errors out if the _parent_ directory/directories of the\n  specified directory don't yet exist.\n\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  mkdir newdir1/newdir2\n  #> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘newdir1/newdir2’: No such file or directory\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  mkdir -p newdir1/newdir2    # This successfully creates both directories\n  ```\n  :::\n\n\n- If the directory already exists, it won't do anything and won't return an error\n  (which would lead the script to abort at that point with our `set` settings).\n  \n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  mkdir newdir1/newdir2\n  #> mkdir: cannot create directory ‘newdir1/newdir2’: File exists\n  ```\n  :::\n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  mkdir -p newdir1/newdir2   # This does nothing since the dirs already exist\n  ```\n  :::\n\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n**Our more well-developed script now looks as follows:**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\n#!/bin/bash\n#SBATCH --account=PAS2250\n#SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out\n  \n## Bash strict settings\nset -euo pipefail\n\n## Load the software\nmodule load fastqc\n\n## Copy the placeholder variables\ninput_file=\"$1\"\noutput_dir=\"$2\" \n\n# Initial reporting\necho \"# Starting the script fastqc.ch\"\ndate\necho \"# Input FASTQ file:   $input_file\"\necho \"# Output dir:         $output_dir\"\necho\n\n# Create the output dir if needed\nmkdir -p \"$output_dir\"\n\n# Run FastQC\nfastqc --outdir=\"$output_dir\" \"$input_file\"\n\n# Final reporting\necho\necho \"# Listing the output files:\"\nls -lh \"$output_dir\"\n\necho\necho \"# Done with the FastQC script\"\ndate\n\n# (Don't run this in your terminal, but copy it into a .sh text file)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNotice that this script is very similar to our toy scripts from the previous\nsessions:\nmostly standard (\"boilerplate\") code with\n**just a single command to run our program of interest.**\n\nTherefore, you can adopt this script as a template for scripts that run other\ncommand-line programs, and will generally only need minor modifications!\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Keep your scripts simple -- use one program in a script\n\nIn general, it is a good idea to keep your scripts simple and run one program\nper script.\n\nOnce you get the hang of it, it may seem appealing to string a number of programs\ntogether in a single script, so that it's easier to rerun everything &mdash;\nbut that will often end up leading to more difficulties than convenience. \n\nWe'll see below how you can **separate** your code into:\n\n- The scripts that run individual steps of your analysis (again, typically individual programs)\n- A \"master\" or \"runner\" script that orchestrates the running of these individual\n  steps.\n  The code in this script is not run all at once,\n  unless you turn it into a formal\n  workflow, which is beyond the scope of this material.\n\nTo really tie your full set of analyses together in an _actual_\nworkflow / pipeline, you will want to start using a workflow management system\nlike [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or\n[NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/).\n:::\n\n<br>\n\n### Submitting our FastQC script as a batch job\n\nOpen a new file in VS Code\n(&nbsp; {{< fa bars >}} &nbsp; => &nbsp; `File` &nbsp; => &nbsp; `New File`)\nand save it as `fastqc.sh` within your `scripts/` directory.\nPaste in the code above and save the file.\n\nThen, submit the script:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsbatch scripts/fastqc.sh data/fastq/SRR7609467.fastq.gz results/fastqc\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.bash-out}\nSubmitted batch job 12521308\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n### Once again: Where does our output go?\n\n- Output that would have been printed to screen if we had run the script directly:\n  in the Slurm log file `slurm-fastqc-<job-nr>.out`\n  \n- FastQC's main output files (HTML ZIP): to the output directory we specified.\n:::\n\nLet's take a look at the queue:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nsqueue -u $USER\n# Fri Aug 19 10:38:16 2022\n#              JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER    STATE       TIME TIME_LIMI  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n#           12521308 serial-40 fastqc.s   jelmer  PENDING       0:00   1:00:00      1 (None)\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce it's no longer in the list produced by `squeue`, it's done.\nThen,  let's check the Slurm log file[^1]:\n\n[^1]: For longer running jobs,\n      you may also want to keep an eye on the log file while it's running.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\ncat slurm-fastqc-12521308.out    # You'll have a different number in the file name\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-note

name\n```\n\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```{.bash-out}\nStarting FastQC script\nFri Aug 19 10:39:52 EDT 2022\nInput FASTQ file:   data/fastq/SRR7609467.fastq.gz\nOutput dir:

the VS Code file browser in the\nside bar.\n**To actually view FastQC's HTML output file**,\nwe unfortunately need to download it with this older version of VS Code\nthat's installed at OSC &mdash;\nbut the ability to download files from here is a nice one!\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=img/vscode_download.png width=\"50%\">\n</p>\n\n<br>\n\n## Running FastQC for all FASTQ files in a loop\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n#### Add keyboard shortcut to run shell commands from the editor:\n\n- Click the <i class=\"fa fa-cog\"></i> (bottom-left) => `Keyboard Shortcuts`.\n\n- Find `Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal`, click on it,\n  then add a shortcut, e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n:::\n\n### A \"workflow\" file\n\nSo far, we've been typing our commands to run or submit scripts directly\nin the terminal.\n**But it's better to directly save these sorts of commands.**\n\nTherefore, we will now create a new file for the purpose of documenting the\nsteps that we are taking, and the scripts that we are submitting.\n**You can think of this file as your analysis lab notebook[^2].**\n\n[^2]: Though possibly a highly sanitized one -- you may want to store daily\n      notes and dead ends in a separate file.\n\nIt's easiest to also save this as a shell script (`.sh`) extension,\neven though it is not at all like the other scripts we've made,\nwhich are meant to be run/submitted in their entirety.\n\n:::{.callout-caution collapse=\"true\"}\n## Not like the other scripts\n\nOnce we've added multiple batch job steps,\nand the input of say step 2 depends on the output of step 1,\nwe won't be able to just _run_ the script as is.\nThis is because all the jobs would then be submitted at the same time,\nand step 2 would likely start running before step 1 is finished.\n\nThere are some possibilities with `sbatch` to make batch jobs wait on each\nother (e.g. the `--dependency` option), but this gets tricky quickly.\nAs also mentioned above, if you want a fully automatically rerunnable workflow /\npipeline, you should consider using a workflow management system\nlike [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) or\n[NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/).\n:::\n\nSo let's go ahead and open a new text file, and save it as `workflow.sh`.\n\n<br>\n\n### Looping over all our files\n\nThe script that we wrote above will run FastQC for a single FASTQ file.\nNow, we will write a loop that iterates over all of our FASTQ files\n(only 8 in this case, but could be 100s just the same),\nand **submits a batch job for each of them.**\n\nLet's type the following into our `workflow.sh` script,\nand then copy-and-paste it into the terminal to run the loop:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.bash .cell-code}\nfor fastq_file in data/fastq/*fastq.gz; do\n    sbatch scripts/fastqc.sh \"$fastq_file\" results/fastqc\ndone\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.bash-out}\nSubmitted batch job 2451089  \nSubmitted batch job 2451090  \nSubmitted batch job 2451091  \nSubmitted batch job 2451092   \nSubmitted batch job 2451093  \nSubmitted batch job 2451094  \nSubmitted batch job 2451095  \nSubmitted batch job 2451096\n:::\n\n:::{.exercise}\n### On Your Own: Check if everything went well {-}\n\n- Use `squeue` to monitor your jobs.\n\n- Take a look at the Slurm log files while the jobs are running and/or after the\n  jobs are finished.\n  A nice trick when you have many log files to check,\n  is to use `tail` with a wildcard:\n  \n\n  ::: {.cell}\n  \n  ```{.bash .cell-code}\n  tail slurm-fastqc*\n  ```\n  :::\n\n- Take a look at the FastQC output files: are you seeing 12 HTML files?  \n\n:::\n\n<br>\n",
